The python implementation of password generator project is using random and tkinter modules.

Import random: To randomly generate a password we use this module. Random is a built-in module used to generate a random subset or a substring of a list, array or string.

from tkinter import messagebox: In case the user fails to provide inputs, we must raise a prompt. Thus we use messagebox to raise such prompts
from tkinter import *: To use widgets and define the application interface, we import tkinter
